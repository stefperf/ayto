=== START OF THE GAME ===
The oracle has randomly chosen this solution:
[4, 6, 2, 1, 8, 5, 0, 3, 7, 9]
The solver has 10 days to guess it.
The solver knows that there are 3628800 admissible permutations now.
Based on the admissible permutations, the solver knows that these are the couple probabilities:
[[0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100]

 [0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100]

 [0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100 0.100]]
